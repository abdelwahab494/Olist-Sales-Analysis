# Olist Sales Analysis  

## 📌 Introduction  
This project analyzes sales data from **Olist**, a Brazilian e-commerce platform that connects sellers with buyers. 
The analysis is based on an **SQLite database** containing details about orders, products, sellers, and customers. 
SQL queries are used to extract insights, and the results are visualized using **Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**.
