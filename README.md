# Olist Sales Analysis  

## Introduction  
This project analyzes sales data from **Olist**, a Brazilian e-commerce platform that connects sellers with buyers. 
The analysis is based on an **SQLite database** containing details about orders, products, sellers, and customers. 
SQL queries are used to extract insights, and the results are visualized using **Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**.

## Project Structure  
- **`Olist.ipynb`** → Jupyter Notebook containing the main code.  
- **`data/olist.sqlite`** → SQLite database (must be downloaded or referenced in the correct path). [Download From Here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/terencicp/e-commerce-dataset-by-olist-as-an-sqlite-database)
- **`README.md`** → This file, providing an overview of the project.  

## Analysis Objectives  
The project aims to analyze sales data from multiple perspectives, including:  
1. **Total sales per seller** → Identifying the top-performing sellers.  
2. **Top 10 best-selling products** → Determining the most in-demand products.  
3. **Monthly revenue analysis** → Understanding seasonal sales trends.  
4. **Top 20 cities by sales** → Analyzing geographical sales distribution.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, SQLite  
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Database**: SQLite  

## Data Analysis  
### Total Sales per Seller  
Extracting total revenue generated by each seller, ranked by highest earnings.  

### Top 10 Best-Selling Products  
Calculating the total units sold and revenue generated for each product.  

### Monthly Sales Revenue  
Tracking revenue over time to identify seasonal patterns.  

### Top 20 Cities by Sales  
Analyzing sales distribution across different cities.  

## How to Run the Project  
1. Install the required dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn sqlite3
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`Olist.ipynb`) and run the cells in order.  
3. Ensure the **database path is correctly set** in the code.  

## Key Insights & Outputs  
- Visualizations illustrating sales trends.  
- Ranking of sellers and products by sales performance.  
- Monthly and regional sales distribution analysis.  

## Notes  
- Ensure that the **SQLite database (`olist.sqlite`)** is available in the correct directory.  
- Further analysis could include customer reviews' impact on sales.  

## Future Enhancements  
- Analyzing product ratings and their influence on sales.  
- Studying the effect of shipping times on customer satisfaction.  
- Developing an **interactive dashboard** for dynamic data exploration.
